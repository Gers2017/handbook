# Governance

This document describes how decisions for the p2panda project are made. In particular this includes decisions on strategic objectives and community participation. This governance structure assumes good-will: it does not try to handle all possible cases of what could go wrong but attempts to provide some grounding clarity.

This document is not supposed to last forever, it may be changed to adopt to the changing nature of the project (see  [_Evolution_](#Evolution)).

## Basics

The p2panda project creates the p2panda protocol, builds software libraries and tooling for the protocol, publishes documentation and other resources, provides servers and services running on those servers, holds meetings and events for its community and draws pictures of pandas.

_The maintainers_ hold decision-making power while seeking to represent a balance of the views and the best interests of the community as a whole. See [_Current Maintainers_](#Current-Maintainers) for a listing.

This document refers to the whole of maintainers with the words "the maintainers" and single members of the maintainers as "any maintainer".

Decisions by the maintainers are made in unanimity.

Our core values for making decisions are: mutual respect, open-mindedness, human-centric approaches, inclusion. These are vague words but we include them here to provide new community members with a vibe check.

## Participants

Participation is open to anyone who wants to join as long as they are not a Nazi.

Participants involved in the development of open source resources are _contributors_, participants involved in strategy and fundraising are _advisors_, participants involved in drinking beers and discussing everything are _philosophers_, together these are the project's _community_.

The maintainers can remove misbehaving participants at will for the sake of the common good. In addition, our [code of conduct][1] describes our expections for _all_ community members, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

In the event that any maintainer is unable or unwilling to continue maintenance, they may propose a replacement, which the remaining maintainers must agree to.

## Forking

We license code and assets under permissive open-source licenses whenever reasonable.

We welcome forking of the project by anyone who wants to take development in a different direction than the maintainers. Forks should communicate in a publicly visible place that they are based off of p2panda. 

We strive to maintain compatibility with forks whenever reasonable and not in conflict with any policies.

Forks must not use any of the p2panda code repositories' names as project names.

## Policy

The maintainers may set policies for contribution to the project, taking reasonable account of input from other community participants. The maintainers are responsible for implementing or delegating the implementation of such policies.

Using _the p2panda voice_ is assuming p2panda as an identity when communicating publicly. Any maintainer may use the voice.

Anyone is free to discuss and debate community policies, practices, and culture. If contributors are not happy with the maintainers' leadership, they are free to voice their concerns in [the Wolke][2] or by [sending an email to the maintainers][3].

## Access to Non-Code Resources

Access to servers and online service accounts sits with the maintainers. The maintainers may share access with contributors and advisors.

The maintainers manage all funds; distribution of funds is made public through a [public copy of our budget][4].

## Evolution

The maintainers can change the governance structure at will.

Changes and the history of this document are made available [publicly][5].
