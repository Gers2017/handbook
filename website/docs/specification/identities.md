## Authors

Authors are humans, shared identities or bots that publish and modify documents on a p2panda network. In their simplest form they would be made up of a single [key pair][keypairs] on a single device, however the term also refers to groups of [key pairs][keypairs] which want to share a single identity (read about `key groups` in the [authorisation][authorisation] section to find out how this happens). This means that an author could be: someone who writes blog posts, someone who edits a wiki, a co-operative publishing a website, a band releasing an album.
