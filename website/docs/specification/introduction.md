p2panda is a peer-to-peer protocol and event-driven data store for secure, energy-efficient and local-first applications. It can be used in both fully distributed and federated network topologies, offers encryption (via MLS), multi-writer editing and data schemas. The specification is compatible with being implemented in both native and web applications. The protocol is based on the Bamboo append-only log that supports transitive partial replication and local deletion.
