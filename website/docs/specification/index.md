We have structured this specification around core data types, higher-order concepts which build on these types, required APIs and networking patterns.

To see a detailed specification of all data types visit [Core Data Types][bamboo], higher order concepts of [Identities], [Documents & Schema][documents-and-schema], [Authorisation] and [Encryption] are described in sections 5 - 8, following this we detail the specific [APIs] an implementation must make available and finally [Networking] describes actors in the network and replication protocol.
