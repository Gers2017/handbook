## Status

We haven't reached `v1` of the specification yet so although it is in a relatively stable state breaking changes may still occur.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Requirements

- In this document we assign a code to every specification requirement an implementation of p2panda would need to meet.
- Some of these codes refer to a specific requirement and some a group of related requirements.
