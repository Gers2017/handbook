# Schema Migrations and Lenses

:::info not implemented
Migrations and lenses are in specification phase and have not been implemented yet.

- Schema migrations allow schema authors to publish changes to schemas while maintaining backwards compatibility
- Lenses allow application developers to access data of a schema at a particular schema version regardless of the schema that the data was published with
    - See Ink&Switch's [essay on lenses](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/)
