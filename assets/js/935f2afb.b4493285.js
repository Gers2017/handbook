documents on a p2panda network. In their simplest form they would be made up of a single key pair on a single device, however the term also refers to groups of key pairs which want to share a single identity (read about key groups in the permissions section to find out how this happens). This means that an author coud be: someone who writes blog posts, someone who edits a wiki, a co-operative publishing a website, a band releasing an album.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/core-concepts/documents-and-schema":{"id":"specification/core-concepts/documents-and-schema","title":"Documents & Schema","description":"Documents","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/core-concepts/encryption":{"id":"specification/core-concepts/encryption","title":"Encryption","description":"p2panda uses the MLS (Messaging Layer Security) protocol for group key negotiation to establish secrets in a large group of users.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/core-concepts/permissions":{"id":"specification/core-concepts/permissions","title":"Permissions","description":"The key_group schema is a way to group a set of public keys so that they can act as a single identity. Every member key can have different permissions limiting the extent to which they can publish operations as this single identity. Keys can only be added to a key group with a confirmation from both the key itself and an existing member key with the according permissions. Key groups can also be extended with other key groups, which extends the set of keys in the former with those from the latter. Key groups can serve as a building block for many other concepts in p2panda including identity (handles/usernames), multi-device usage, permissions and moderation.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/data-types/bamboo":{"id":"specification/data-types/bamboo","title":"Bamboo","description":"- requirements in this section refer only to how p2panda specifies use of bamboo","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/data-types/document-views":{"id":"specification/data-types/document-views","title":"Document views","description":"- document views represent the immutable state of a document at a particular point in its history of edits","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/data-types/documents":{"id":"specification/data-types/documents","title":"Documents","description":"- A Document is a high-level mutable, multi-writer data type constructed from a linked graph of operations.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/data-types/key-pairs":{"id":"specification/data-types/key-pairs","title":"Key Pairs","description":"Key pairs MUST use ED25519 keys.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/data-types/operations":{"id":"specification/data-types/operations","title":"Operations","description":"- Operations represent atomic data changes.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/data-types/schemas":{"id":"specification/data-types/schemas","title":"Schemas","description":"- schemas are used to describe and validate the format in which data is published","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/encoding-data":{"id":"specification/encoding-data","title":"Encoding","description":"- p2panda requires a canonical encoding format to guarantee that hashing a value produces the same result across all implementations.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/index":{"id":"specification/index","title":"Overview","description":"Requirements","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/networking/clients-nodes":{"id":"specification/networking/clients-nodes","title":"Clients and nodes","description":"- p2panda has a clear separation of clients and nodes to allow flexible setups and make client development easier","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/networking/discovery":{"id":"specification/networking/discovery","title":"Discovery","description":"Discovery is in specification phase and has not been implemented yet.","sidebar":"specification"},"specification/networking/replication-protocol":{"id":"specification/networking/replication-protocol","title":"Replication Protocol","description":"- replication is the process by which nodes exchange entries and operations to eventually converge all to the same state","sidebar":"specification"},"tutorials/index":{"id":"tutorials/index","title":"Tutorials","description":""}}}')}}]);
