# RFC 0001: Schema

A schema describes data that is stored and indexed on a server. It defines  message types that can be created by clients in the network. From another perspective one could understand a schema as a specification of materialized views over all bamboo logs (inspired by Kappa Database Architecture). Having the possibility to define custom schemas for the server allows for a flexible and fast introduction of new message types, use-cases and clients in the network.

Each schema can be installed, changed or removed on a server by running schema migrations. A schema migration is a message type by itself and is stored as an entry on a bamboo log. Each schema migration message consists of a simple description of message fields including their names and types.

## Terminology

- **entry**: An entry in a [bamboo log](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/bamboo)
- **message**: A p2panda message contained in an entry, can be either a *schema message* or an *instance message*
- **schema message**: Contains instructions used to define a database schema and a specification for *instance messages*.
- **instance message**: Contains instructions that can be applied to a database schema in order to instantiate *instances*.
- **instance**: A row in a database that represents an object within a p2panda-based application

## Overview

A schema describes a database schema and a message specification through a series of schema migrations. A schema is represented by a bamboo log. Every message on the log is a schema migration. Thereby, the version number of a schema is defined by the *sequence number* of the migration's log entry.

Each schema migration is one of:

- `schema-meta`: sets schema metadata
- `schema-migration`: Used by server to create or alter database tables and to migrate *instance messages*.
- `schema-revert`: Used by server to revert to an earlier version, recreating instance data, which may have been deleted or corrupted by intermittent migrations.

Just like the schema itself, instances of the schema are described by messages. However, these instance messages are encoded in bamboo entries of users‚Äô logs - not the schema log. Every instance message specifies a *versioned schema*.

Possible instance message kinds are:

- `create`: creates a database row
- `update`: updates a row
- `delete`: drops a row

## Usage

Implementations of the p2panda schema should allow for easy and fun usage. This section outlines a couple of essential user flows using a (non-existent) command line interface `panda`.

All of the examples presume an already existing bamboo keypair on the local computer.

### Creating a new schema

The `panda` command line application is used to register a new schema for the fictional *slothmail* application.

```bash
$ panda schema slothmail init --description "Send slothmail to your friends!"
üêº Registered slothmail schema at log 12
```

The *slothmail* schema's log was initialized in the local users log number 12.

A couple of fields are added to the schema by reading from a migration definition:

```bash
$ panda schema slothmail migrate slothmail-001.yaml
Created fields 
- subject<text>
- body<text>
- created<datetime>
- recipient<panda-profile>

üêº Published slothmail version 2
```

The *slothmail* application can now start publishing slothmail messages.

### Inspecting a schema

The panda cli can also be used to inspect a schema.

```bash
$ panda schema slothmail
name: slothmail
spec: 1
description: Send slothmail to your friends!
source: 
  - 88e1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb
  - 12
  - 4
fields:
  - subject:
    type: text
  - body:
    type: text
  - recipient:
    type: relation
    schema: 
      - d4a1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb
      - 10
  - created:
    type: timestamp
```

### Materializing a new schema with a server

All p2panda servers make available their user's log entries to each other. In addition to that, they can offer materialized views of some of the data contained in those logs. For this, server administrators instruct the server to index messages of a certain schema.

Here, the *slothmail* schema is indexed. It is referred to by the public key of the schema's author and the log id in which that author published the schema. 

```bash
$ beep-beep-server index 88e1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb 12
üéç Now indexing slothmail messages
```

## Messages

Messages are encoded using YAML 1.2.

## Initial Schema instantiation

When instantiating a schema, a server executes all migrations in the schema‚Äôs log. This creates a database table capable of holding instances of the schema at its latest known version. All known *instance messages* are also applied, which results in the database contents representing all known instances at their latest versions.

Migrations can also be applied to messages in order to make them compatible with the current schema version. When an incoming message specifies a schema version older than the latest known schema version, all intermittent migrations are applied to this message so that it can be applied to the database. When a message specifies a schema version that is not known, the server tries to request that schema version‚Äôs entry using bamboo.

## Schema migration messages

### Meta schema message

A meta schema message describes the schema itself. It contains following fields. Only those marked with an X in the "Required" column are required.

| Field name | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | Name of the schema | X |
| spec | Which verison of this schema meta-spec is implemented | X |
| description | Description of the schema's purpose | |
| homepage | URL pointing at a web site for the schema | |
| license | A comma-separated list of licenses that apply for the schema definition | |
| contact | An email-address for contacting the schema's authors | |

#### Examples

Minimal meta schema message for a fictional messaging format *slothmail*.

```yaml
kind: schema-meta
name: slothmail
spec: 1
```

Example using all available fields

```yaml
kind: schema-meta
name: slothmail
spec: 1
description: Send slothmail to your friends!
homepage: https://liebechaos.org/activity/slothmail
license: CC-BY-SA 2.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/>
contact: info@liebechaos.org
```

### Migrate schema message

A migrate schema message creates or alters the schema‚Äôs table and updates its rows. A migration describes changes to one or more fields. If no database table exists for the schema, a new database table is created when applying the message. Server implementations should consider that schema names are non-unique when constructing table names.

Fields may be created, updated or removed. For each created or updated field, a new data type is specified. For updated fields, a default value must be specified that is stored if conversion to the new data type fails. Each field is described by its

- action (`create`, `update`, or `remove`)
- name (unicode string)
- type (see below)
- validation (optional regex pattern)

Type must be one of:

- `varchar` (max 255 chars)
- `text`
- `integer`
- `float`
- `boolean`
- `timestamp` (ISO-8601 timestamp)
- `relation`

Every type may also be specified as an array by adding `[]` behind the type name.

A `relation` type also specifies the `versioned-schema` of its foreign key. A `relation` type may specify `cascade: true` in which case schema instances are deleted once the foreign key is deleted.

The field `validation` may contain a regular expression used to validate messages of this schema.

If a `schema-migration` message removes the last of a schema‚Äôs fields, the schema‚Äôs database table may be dropped.

#### Examples

Example to create the *slothmail* schema

```yaml
kind: schema-migration
fields:
  - subject:
    action: create
    type: text
  - body:
    action: create
    type: text
  - recipient:
    action: create
    type: relation
    schema: 
      # author for the schema of the recipient field
      - d4a1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb
      # schema's log id
      - 10
      # relation is schema-version agnostic
  - created:
    action: create
    type: timestamp
```

Example to add an attachments field to the slothmail schema:

```yaml
kind: schema-migration
fields:
  - attachments:
    action: create
    type: relation[]
    schema: 
      - ac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffbd4a1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5d
      - 78434
```

Example to remove the attachments field and change the subject to not contain line breaks

```yaml
kind: schema-migration
fields:
  - attachments
    action: remove
  - subject
    action: update
    validation: ^[^#\r\n].*$
    default: <Subject>
```

### Revert schema message

A revert schema message reverts previous migrations and resets the database to a previous schema version (`target`). This is desirable instead of reverting by altering fields in order to restore data deleted by previous migrations.

The database is recreated by dropping the database and reapplying all known instance messages and all migrations up to the target migration. Create and update instance messages, which specify a schema version later than the target version are ignored. `delete` instance messages are applied regardless of the version mismatch in order to prevent schema authors from restoring user data against their will.

#### Examples

The previous example removed the `attachments` field. During migration all slothmail attachments were deleted from slothmail instances. Simply adding the field back would not recover the deleted attachments. Here, the schema is reverted to a previous version that still had the `attachments` field, which recreates all the attachments by re-indexing all slothmail instances.

```yaml
kind: schema-revert
target: 2
```

## Instance messages

Every *instance message* affects exactly one row of the schema‚Äôs table. 

Every instance has an author and can only be altered by *instance messages* from this author.

All *instance messages* for one author and schema are contained in the same log. This log may also contain messages for other schemas.

### Create instance message

Applying a `create` instance message inserts one new row into the schema‚Äôs table. The message contains:

- `versioned-schema`
- a sequence of `field` contents indexed by the field's name

Instances are identified by the `sequence number` of the create instance message. This is called the instance's `instance-id`.

Applying a migration to a create instance message transforms the contents to conform to the a new schema version.

#### Examples

Example to create a slothmail message. Here, the message is created using an older version of the schema than that of the last example.

```yaml
kind: create
schema: 
  - 88e1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb
  - 12
  # schema's version (sequence number)
  - 1
fields:
  - subject: |
    Hello!
    ...friend
  # fields may be empty
  - body: 
  - created: 2020-05-22T11:58:50+0000
```

Note that the subject field contains a multi-line string. A server that already applied the migration that changed the subject field to only allow single-line content may migrate this message in order to be compatible. As the subject line would fail the validation check, it would be replaced with the default value `<Subject>`.

### Update instance message

An update instance message updates the row specified by the instance id. For one or more of the fields of the schema, the row is updated with new contents.

Applying a migration to an update instance message transforms the content that is written when applying the message.

#### Examples

Example to update the previous slothmail message, fixing the subject line to be one line only.

```yaml
kind: update
schema:
  - 88e1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb
  - 12
  - 4
instance: 98e1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb
fields:
  - subject: Hello! ...friend
```

### Delete instance message

A delete instance message drops a table row referred to by an instance id.

Applying a migration to a delete instance message may make it obsolete if the affected row is deleted by a migration.

#### Examples

Example to delete the slothmail message.

```yaml
kind: delete
instance: 98e1cb88a66f02f8db635ce26441cc5dac1b08420ceaac230839b755845a9ffb
```
